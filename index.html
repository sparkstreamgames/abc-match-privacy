        <h1>Privacy Policy for ABC MATCH</h1>
        
        <p class="effective-date">
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 11, 2025<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 11, 2025
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>SparkStream, LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the ABC MATCH mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our App.</p>
        
        <p>ABC MATCH is designed for children and we take children's privacy seriously. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable privacy laws.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Information We DO NOT Collect</h3>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names</li>
            <li>Email addresses</li>
            <li>Phone numbers</li>
            <li>Physical addresses</li>
            <li>Photos or videos</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Contact lists</li>
            <li>Any other personally identifiable information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
        
        <h4>Advertising Services (Google AdMob)</h4>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in our App. AdMob may automatically collect certain information for advertising purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and model</li>
            <li>Operating system version</li>
            <li>Unique device identifiers</li>
            <li>IP address (which may indicate general location)</li>
            <li>App usage data and interaction with ads</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> We have configured AdMob to serve only child-directed, non-personalized advertisements in compliance with COPPA. This means AdMob does not use persistent identifiers to track children across apps or websites for behavioral advertising.</p>
        </div>

        <p>For more information about Google's privacy practices, please visit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li>Google AdMob Privacy Information: <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>The limited device information collected by AdMob is used solely for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying advertisements within the App</li>
            <li>Measuring ad performance and detecting fraud</li>
            <li>Providing core App functionality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use any information for purposes beyond ad serving and App operation.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>ABC MATCH is designed for children and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h3>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not require children to provide any personal information to use the App</li>
            <li>We use only child-directed, non-personalized advertising</li>
            <li>We do not share children's information with third parties except as necessary to provide the App service (displaying ads)</li>
            <li>Parents can review our privacy practices at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Parental Controls</h3>
        <p>Parents can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review this Privacy Policy at any time</li>
            <li>Contact us with questions about our privacy practices</li>
            <li>Request information about the types of data collected through AdMob</li>
        </ul>

        <p>On iOS devices, parents can limit ad tracking by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Going to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</li>
            <li>Disabling "Allow Apps to Request to Track"</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>App Tracking Transparency (iOS)</h2>
        <p>When you first open ABC MATCH on an iOS device, you will see a prompt asking for permission to track your activity. This tracking is used solely for personalized advertising. You may choose to allow or deny this permission. Your choice does not affect the core functionality of the App, but ads may be less relevant if you deny tracking permission.</p>

        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any personal information with third parties. The only information sharing that occurs is:</p>
        
        <p><strong>With Google AdMob:</strong> Limited device information is shared with Google AdMob for the purpose of displaying advertisements, as described above.</p>

        <p>We may disclose information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect information processed through our App. However, please note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
        
        <p>Since we do not collect or store personal information directly, the risk of data breach is minimal.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>Our App may contain advertisements that link to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage parents to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        
        <h3>California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights regarding your information:</p>

            <li>Right to opt-out of the sale of information (Note: We do not sell information)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal information directly, these rights primarily relate to information collected by AdMob. To exercise your rights regarding AdMob data, please visit Google's privacy controls.</p>

        <h3>European Union Residents (GDPR)</h3>
        <p>If you are in the European Union, you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy</li>
            <li>Posting the new Privacy Policy in the App (if technically feasible)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        <p>Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" feature. Our App does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals because there is no industry standard for how to respond to such signals.</p>

        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Information collected by AdMob may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have different data protection laws. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to the United States and other countries.</p>
